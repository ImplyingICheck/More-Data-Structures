# More Data Structures

A collection of data structures written in pure python. The package is light (no dependencies) and user-friendly by way of a consistent API.

## Implemented

- Trie

## Inspiration
While working on various side projects, I repeatedly ran into situations where I wanted to test various data structures. While PyPi has plenty of implementations, each follows differing API structures, requiring the user to read documentation for every single data structure to be tested. Additionally, many of the packages had external dependencies, which would translate to more one-off dependencies for the final project.

## Purpose
This collection of data structures is primarily intended to be used for prototyping (and as a learning exercise).

Tests will be implemented to ensure consistent behaviour. 

As of version 0.1.0, the API is not stable. However, a stable API will be established in the future.

## Goals

- [] Implement SkipList
- [] Implement RedBlackTree
- [] Implement AVL Tree

Other data structures to be determined...

## Stretch Goals
These goals may or may not come into fruition (largely dependent on time available and learning goals).
- [] Rewrite in Rust
- [] Create python wrapper for Rust implementation
